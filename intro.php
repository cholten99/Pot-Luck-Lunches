      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      I've put together this quick demo to get feedback from people before doing some more work (always throw out an 'aplha').<p/>
      <a href="mailto:dave@bowsy.co.uk">Please send feedback to me here</a>.<p/>
      Known issues:
      <ul>
        <li>Feedback on UI needed
        <li>Missing page title(s)
        <li>Cookie and / or session times out after a while of staying on the main page. Leaving it open for a long time before coming back to it causes the app to fail.
        <li>Need to write the part of the app that send off automated emails every working day morning to let people who have a PLL that day who they are meeting up with.
        <li>Need to define the locations for the original release.
        <li>Need to work out how to explain to people how it works.
        <li>Does it need a button to clear all tickboxes?
        <li>Does it need to be able to delete accounts?
        <li>Password resets?
        <li>Email conformation?
        <li>Mechanism for people to record meeting up (might be just a twitter address - if so add feed to page?).
        <li>Performance platform equivalent...
      </ul>
